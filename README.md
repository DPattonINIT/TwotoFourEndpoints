 // Brief Description of what you did. 
I created a project that contains multiple endpoints that perform different tasks. I created controllers, each handling specific routes and using services to perform logic. Then I  registered these services in the Program.cs file, set up routing, and enabled Swagger/Postman to test.

Comments: All 3 of your endpoints work as intended and run smoothly. One detail that I liked that you found was that you were able to include your route in your HttpGet's. I didn't think that the code would work but you found something different! Nice job overall!
