MiniChallengeTwoToFour - Endpoints

 // Brief Description of what you did. 
I created a project that contains multiple endpoints that perform different tasks. I created controllers, each handling specific routes and using services to perform logic. Then I  registered these services in the Program.cs file, set up routing, and enabled Swagger/Postman to test.
